Neutron Notes
=============

The following notes have already been incorporated into the
baremetal-neutron-dhcp branches of devstack and nova, and this
(neutron-dhcp) branch of tripleo-incubator. Most of the differences are
contained in tripleo-incubator/localrc and devstack/lib/neutron. There
are also several patches to Nova.

These notes are preserved in a single place just for clarity. You do not
need to follow these instructions.

Instructions
------------

After starting devstack, fixup your neutron networking. You want a
provider network, connected through to eth1, with ip addresses on the
bridge.

/etc/neutron/plugins/openvswitch/ovs\_neutron\_plugin.ini should already
have the following two lines, but check just in case

::

    network_vlan_ranges=ctlplane
    bridge_mappings=ctlplane:br-ctlplane

you will need to add a port to the bridge

::

    sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br-ctlplane eth1

and move ip addresses to it

::

    sudo ip addr del 192.0.2.1/24 dev eth1
    sudo ip addr del 192.0.2.33/29 dev eth1
    sudo ip addr add 192.0.2.33/29 dev br-ctlplane
    sudo ip addr add 192.0.2.1/24 dev br-ctlplane

you need to replace the private network definition

::

    export OS_USERNAME=admin neutron net-list

then neutron net-show of the existing 192.0.2.33 network and get the tenant
id, then delete and recreate it

::

    neutron net-delete
    neutron net-create ctlplane --tenant-id --provider:network_type flat --provider:physical_network ctlplane
    neutron subnet-create --ip-version 4 --allocation-pool start=192.0.2.34,end=192.0.2.38 --gateway=192.0.2.33 192.0.2.32/29
    sudo ifconfig br-ctlplane up

then kill and restart q-svc and q-agt and q-dhcp, bm-helper's dnsmasq: -
in screen -x stack ctrl-c and restart them - for bm-helper, run this by
hand after killing the old dnsmasq

::

    dnsmasq --conf-file= --port=0 --enable-tftp --tftp-root=/tftpboot --dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0 --bind-interfaces --pid-file=/var/run/dnsmasq.pid --dhcp-range=192.0.2.65,192.0.2.69,29 --interface=br-ctlplane
