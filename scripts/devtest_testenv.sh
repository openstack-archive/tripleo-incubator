## #. Set HW resources for VMs used as 'baremetal' nodes. NODE_CPU is cpu count,
##    NODE_MEM is memory (MB), NODE_DISK is disk size (GB), NODE_ARCH is
##    architecture (i386, amd64). NODE_ARCH is used also for the seed VM.
##    A note on memory sizing: TripleO images in raw form are currently
##    ~2.7Gb, which means that a tight node will end up with a thrashing page
##    cache during glance -> local + local -> raw operations. This significantly
##    impairs performance. Of the four minimum VMs for TripleO simulation, two
##    are nova baremetal nodes (seed and undercloud) and these need to be 2G or
##    larger. The hypervisor host in the overcloud also needs to be a decent size
##    or it cannot host more than one VM.
